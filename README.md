Bubble blaster
==============

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mewbak/bubble-blaster/master/screenshots/screenshot.png)

This is a mod of [gonutz](https://github.com/gonutz)'s [no-brain-jogging game](https://github.com/gonutz/no-brain-jogging). To make the game more relaxing we added tranquilent background music, replaced the zombies with big eyed gold fish and added a bubble blaster instead of a rifle. And, to make it more challenging we added modulo.

In this game you solve math calculations to shoot your bubble blaster and cuddle some goldfish. Cuddle as many as you can before they cuddle you.
